## How It Works

The program uses the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 9. Based on the generated number, it provides one of nine possible answers to the user's yes/no question.

## Usage

1. Set your name and question in the script:
    ```python
    name = "Your Name"
    question = "Your question"
    ```

2. Run the `magic8.py` script to get an answer to your yes/no question:
    ```bash
    python magic8.py
    ```
